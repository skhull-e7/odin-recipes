    <h2>What Does Lasagna Mean?</h2>
    <p>The origins of the word lasagne or lasagna can be traced back to <strong>Ancient Greece</strong>. What we know as
        lasagne or lasagna is derived from the word “laganon”, which was the first form of pasta. Laganon was a
        reference to flat sheets of pasta dough cut into thin strips. As you might expect, Laganon looked very different
        from what we know to be a typical lasagna dish today. It consisted of layers of pasta and sauce without
        traditional Italian ingredients. Ancient Rome was known to have a similar dish called “lasanum”, which is Latin
        for container or pot. Italians used this word to refer to the pot that the dish was served in. Eventually, the
        dish evolved and took on the same name. The origins of what we know as twisted macaroni came later.</p>
    <p>Lasagne is the plural word for one sheet of lasagna and is used regionally throughout Italy. Referencing lasagne
        or lasagna depends on whether you're in the northern or southern regions of Italy. The plural form is mostly
        used in British English, while American English is known to use the singular version.</p>

    <h3>How to make Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato
            sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of
            flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta,
            shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great
            flavor!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce,
            followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
