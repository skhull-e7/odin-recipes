    <h2>What is Pasta?</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and
        formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or
        lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free
        alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.</p>
    <p>Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is
        produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is
        traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery
        stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.</p>
    <p>Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300
        documented names. In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the
        pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta
        include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled
        or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>All-purpose flour</strong> - In the past, I thought you needed 00 flour or semolina flour to make great fresh pasta,
            but this homemade pasta recipe proved me wrong. In it, regular all-purpose flour yields chewy, bouncy
            noodles every time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eggs</strong> - The key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to the dough!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Olive oil</strong> - Along with the eggs, a splash of olive oil moistens the dough and helps it come together.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt</strong> - Add it to the dough and the pasta water for the best flavor.
        </li>
    </ul>
